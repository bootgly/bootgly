# Changelog

Changelog for Bootgly framework. All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. Imported from ROADMAP.md.

## v0.14.5-beta ✅

> Focus: **Prevent handler execution before HTTP request body is fully received**

### WPI — Web Programming Interface

- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `Encoder_` — production encoder now defers handler dispatch until the request body is fully received, preventing partial-body handler execution that could expose incomplete data to application logic
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Security regression test `17.01-handler_before_body_completion` covering premature handler dispatch scenario

---

## v0.14.4-beta ✅

> Focus: **BodyParser cross-route limit leak and Content-Length smuggling prevention**

### WPI — Web Programming Interface

- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `BodyParser` — middleware no longer mutates the global `Request::$maxBodySize` static; limit is now applied per-request at decode time via a temporary override, preventing a low-limit route from silently capping uploads on all subsequent routes
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `Request` — hardened against HTTP request smuggling via `Content-Length` placed as first header; security regression tests `12.01-bodyparser_limit_bypass_decode_time`, `16.01-bodyparser_global_maxbodysize_cross_route_leak`, and `04.03-content_length_first_header_smuggling` added

---

## v0.14.3-beta ✅

> Focus: **Router negative cache pollution prevention — remove static cache promotion for catch-all misses**

### WPI — Web Programming Interface

- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `Router` — removed unbounded promotion of attacker-controlled URLs into `staticCache['']` on catch-all misses; `MAX_NEGATIVE_CACHE` constant and `$negativeCacheCount` field removed; net +1.4% throughput improvement on catch-all 404 scenario
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Security regression test `15.01-router_catchall_negative_cache_pollution` — 500 unique miss URLs; vulnerable build reports 500/500 polluted entries, fixed build reports 0/500

---

## v0.14.2-beta ✅

> Focus: **Arbitrary file inclusion prevention via EXTR_SKIP in Template extract()**

### ABI — Abstract Bootable Interface

- ✅ Templates: `Template::render()` now passes `EXTR_SKIP` to `extract()`, preventing template variables from overwriting local scope variables (including `$__template__`) and closing arbitrary file inclusion via attacker-controlled variable names

### WPI — Web Programming Interface

- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `Response::render()` inherited fix — same EXTR_SKIP protection applied to all HTTP response template rendering
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Security regression test `14.01-response_render_extract_file_inclusion` covering file inclusion via variable override scenario

---

## v0.14.1-beta ✅

> Focus: **Session Set-Cookie deferred until mutation to prevent session fixation and DoS**

### WPI — Web Programming Interface

- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `Session` — `Set-Cookie` emission deferred until session is actually mutated (`set`, `put`, `delete`, `pull`, `forget`, `flush`, `regenerate`); read-only access no longer emits a cookie, closing session fixation and API-probe DoS surface
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Security regression test `13.01-session_unconditional_set_cookie_on_read` covering read-only probe, write-triggers-cookie, and no-session-untouched scenarios

---

## v0.14.0-beta ✅

- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Packages integration in decoders and encoders refactored for consistency with new UDP interfaces
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Added security regression test for `Response::upload()` path traversal guard with `File` instances
- ✅ HTTP Client CLI: Enhanced Demo with improved connection messages

### ACI — Abstract Common Interface

---

## v0.13.18-beta ✅

> Focus: **Multipart upload hardening for hidden filename and safe streaming writes**

### WPI — Web Programming Interface

- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `Decoder_Downloading` now strips leading dots/spaces/tabs from multipart filenames (`ltrim`) to prevent hidden dotfile uploads (e.g. `.htaccess`)
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Sanitization fallback now enforces safe default filename (`upload`) when the sanitized name becomes empty
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Added guarded chunk writer path with explicit write-failure handling, periodic disk-space checks, and per-file size enforcement during streaming upload
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Security regression test `07.02-multipart_filename_leading_dot` validates rejection of leading-dot filename persistence in `$_FILES`
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Security test index cleanup keeps multipart hardening coverage deterministic across suite runs

---

## v0.13.17-beta ✅

> Focus: **Decoder L1 cache hardening against one-shot key churn DoS**

### WPI — Web Programming Interface

- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `Decoder_` L1 cache no longer admits query-bearing targets (`?` in request-target), reducing one-shot attacker key churn admission
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: L1 cache now performs LRU touch on hit (remove + reinsert key) and evicts the oldest key with `array_key_first` when capacity (`512`) is exceeded
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Cache lookup eligibility no longer depends on `Request::$maxBodySize`; `<= 2048` remains the fixed L1 candidate cap
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Security regression coverage expanded with `03.02-decoder_cache_one_shot_key_eviction_dos` and supporting suite-index updates

---


## v0.13.16-beta ✅

> Focus: **Redirect and file-send path hardening in HTTP Server CLI**

### WPI — Web Programming Interface

- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `Response::redirect()` now rejects control bytes (`\x00-\x1F`, `\x7F`), backslashes, dangerous URI schemes (`javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`, `file:`), and non-local redirect forms when `allowExternal` is `false`
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Added security regression test `13.01-open_redirect_backslash_bypass` covering protocol-relative and backslash-based redirect bypass payloads
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `Response::send()` received an additional jail check to block file-require bypass attempts outside allowed view/project boundaries

## v0.13.14-beta ✅

> Focus: **BodyParser body-size limit enforced at decode time**

### WPI — Web Programming Interface

- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `BodyParser::process()` pushes `$this->maxSize` into `Request::$maxBodySize` (idempotent one-way ratchet) — oversized bodies are now rejected at decode time before TCP payload is buffered
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `Decoder_::decode()` L1 cache skips cache hits when `$size > Request::$maxBodySize` — decode-time gate always fires after a `BodyParser` push
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `Request::decode()` size check compares `$content_length` (body only) against `$maxBodySize` instead of `$length` (header + body) — fixes false positives for small-body / large-header requests
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Security test `11.01-bodyparser_limit_bypass_decode_time` — two-connection PoC proves the decoder gate is lowered after priming

---

## v0.13.13-beta ✅

> Focus: **Host-header allowlist enforcement**

### WPI — Web Programming Interface

- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: New `Request::$allowedHosts` static property — when non-empty, requests with an unrecognized `Host` header are rejected `400 Bad Request` at decode time (blocks cache poisoning and password-reset poisoning in multi-tenant apps)
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Wildcard prefix `*.example.com` matches any single-label subdomain; IPv6 bracketed literals handled correctly; empty list (default) disables enforcement
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Security test `10.01-host_header_allowlist_spoofing`

### Bootgly

- ✅ License: Updated copyright notice to `2023-present Bootgly`

---

## v0.13.12-beta ✅

- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Security tests `9.01-expect_100_continue_with_te_chunked`, `9.02-expect_100_continue_with_oversized_content_length`

---

## v0.13.11-beta ✅

> Focus: **Path traversal sibling-prefix bypass in Response + shallow-clone sub-object bleed in Decoder_ cache**

### WPI — Web Programming Interface

- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `Response::process()` and `upload()` — base-path `str_starts_with` checks now append `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR`, closing the sibling-prefix bypass (e.g. `projects_malicious/`)
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `Decoder_` request cache — auth fields (`authUsername`, `authPassword`, `_authorizationHeader`) reinitialized on cache hit, preventing cross-connection credential bleed
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Security tests `7.01-response_path_traversal_sibling_prefix_bypass`, `8.01-decoder_cache_shallow_clone_subobject_bleed`

---

## v0.13.10-beta ✅

> Focus: **TrustedProxy — correct real client IP resolution from multi-hop XFF chains**

### WPI — Web Programming Interface

- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `TrustedProxy` middleware — `X-Forwarded-For` is now walked right-to-left, skipping trusted IPs; the first untrusted entry is the real client IP (previously `$ips[0]` was fully attacker-controlled)
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Multi-hop chain support — requests traversing N trusted hops are correctly resolved

---

## v0.13.9-beta ✅

> Focus: **Multipart boundary validation per RFC 7578 — injection and algorithmic DoS prevention**

### WPI — Web Programming Interface

- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Multipart boundary validated against RFC 7578 `token` ABNF — injected quotes, semicolons, and non-token characters rejected
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Boundary length capped at 70 chars (RFC 2046 §5.1.1) — prevents catastrophic `strpos` scans (algorithmic DoS)
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: Security test `6.01-multipart_boundary_injection_and_oversize`

---

## v0.13.8-beta ✅

> Focus: **Chunked Transfer-Encoding decoder hardening — CRLF validation and hex chunk-size sanitization**

### WPI — Web Programming Interface

- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `Decoder_Chunked` — explicitly validates `\r\n` terminators after each chunk data segment; invalid terminators rejected with `400 Bad Request`
- ✅ HTTP Server CLI: `Decoder_Chunked` — chunk size lines validated against `/^[0-9a-fA-F]+$/`; previously `hexdec()` silently misinterpreted `0x0`, `-1`, `+7`, `0e0`, etc.

  - ✅ `BootCommand` — boot resource directories for consumer projects
  - ✅ `TestCommand` — run Bootgly test suites
  - ✅ `HelpCommand` — display global help with banner, commands, options, usage
  - ✅ `ProjectCommand` — manage projects (list, set, run, info)
- ✅ Removed `ServeCommand` (replaced by `project start --WPI`)

### WPI — Web Programming Interface ✅

- ✅ HTTP Server CLI improvements
  - ✅ `handle(Closure $Handler)` — fluent method for setting request handler with auto `Middlewares` init
  - ✅ Default server mode changed from `Modes::Monitor` to `Modes::Daemon`
  - ✅ Removed legacy `SAPI::$production` / `SAPI::boot()` from default boot case
- ✅ Response `reset()` method — reset response state (headers, body, status) between requests
- ✅ Encoder pipeline refactor (`Encoder_.php`, `Encoder_Testing.php`)
  - ✅ Generator-based routing resolved inside the middleware pipeline (not after)
  - ✅ Proper `$Result instanceof Response` handling after pipeline
- ✅ Router middleware reset per request (`$this->middlewares = []` in `routing()`)

### Bootgly ✅

- ✅ Projects restructured as self-contained directories with `*.project.php` boot files
  - ✅ `projects/Demo/HTTP_Server_CLI/` — HTTP server demo with static/dynamic routing and catch-all 404
  - ✅ `projects/TCP_Server_CLI/` — Raw TCP server with configurable workers
  - ✅ `projects/TCP_Client_CLI/` — TCP client benchmark (10s write/read stress test)
  - ✅ `projects/Demo_CLI/` — Interactive CLI demo for terminal components (22 demos)
- ✅ Scripts refactored — `http-server-cli`, `tcp-server-cli`, `tcp-client-cli` removed (replaced by projects)
- ✅ New `benchmark` script with multi-case support (Bootgly vs competitors, wrk-based, 6 scenarios)(private)
- ✅ Removed `composer.json` `scripts.serve` section (replaced by `project start`)

#### Verifications ✅

- [x] Project `list` discovers CLI + WPI projects and shows interfaces
- [x] Project `set --default` persists to `projects/@.php`
- [x] Project `run` boots default or named project
- [x] Project `info` displays metadata Fieldset
- [x] HTTP Server `handle()` initializes Middlewares and sets Handler
- [x] Response `reset()` clears state between requests
- [x] Generator routing works inside middleware pipeline
- [x] Router middlewares reset between requests (no leaking)
- [x] Static analysis — PHPStan level 9
- [x] Code style — Bootgly conventions / rules

## v0.9.0-beta ✅

> Focus: **new Test definition class + Middleware Pipeline**

### ACI — Abstract Common Interface ✅

- ✅ Tests: new Test definition class (`Specification` used in `*.test.php` with `Separator` value object)

### API — Application Programming Interface ✅

- ✅ Middleware interface (`API/Server/Middleware`)
  - ✅ `process (object $Request, object $Response, Closure $next): object`
  - ✅ Interface-only (one-way policy — no Closure middlewares)
- ✅ Middleware pipeline executor (`API/Server/Middlewares`)
  - ✅ Onion pattern via array reduction (fold right)
  - ✅ `pipe()`, `prepend()`, `append()` registration methods
  - ✅ `process()` execution with handler as innermost Closure
- ✅ Handler resolver (`API/Server/Handlers`)
  - ✅ Adapter: wrap `SAPI::$Handler` as pipeline-compatible Closure
- ✅ Integration in `Encoder_.php` and `Encoder_Testing.php` (wrap `SAPI::$Handler` call with pipeline)
- ✅ Middleware registration API
  - ✅ Global: `$Middlewares->pipe()` in SAPI bootstrap
  - ✅ Per-route group: `$Router->intercept()` inside nested routes
  - ✅ Per-route: `$Router->route(..., middlewares: [])` parameter
- ✅ Test middleware support in `SAPI::boot()` (per-test `'middlewares'` key)

### WPI — Web Programming Interface ✅

- ✅ Built-in middlewares (`WPI/Nodes/HTTP_Server_CLI/Router/Middlewares/`)
  - ✅ CORS (preflight, origin validation, headers)
  - ✅ RateLimit (in-memory counters, per-worker, file persist on shutdown)
  - ✅ BodyParser (max size validation, Content-Length checking)
  - ✅ Compression (gzip/deflate, opt-in via middleware)
  - ✅ ETag (HTTP caching with If-None-Match, weak/strong)
  - ✅ SecureHeaders (X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
  - ✅ RequestId (X-Request-Id UUID v4 header)
  - ✅ TrustedProxy (resolve real IP behind load balancer, X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP, X-Forwarded-Proto)

### Bootgly ✅

#### Verifications ✅

- [x] Middleware pipeline executes in correct onion order (before → handler → after)
- [x] Global middlewares run for every request
- [x] Per-route middlewares run only on matched routes
- [x] Nested route group middlewares execute after match, before handler
- [x] Short-circuit works (e.g., RateLimit returns 429 without calling next)
- [x] CORS preflight returns 204 without hitting handler
- [ ] RateLimit in-memory counters persist/restore on shutdown/boot
- [x] Static analysis — PHPStan level 9
- [x] Code style — Bootgly conventions / rules
- [x] API Server pipeline unit tests (6 tests — Advanced API)
- [x] WPI middleware unit tests with mock (8 tests — Advanced API)
- [x] HTTP Server CLI real integration tests (12 tests — all 8 middlewares)
